jest test:
error: localstorage is not defined. 
Because the website is not actually running. But since the test checked for both valid and invalid login. 
Made a separate test file called "something" in /src, simply to run a successful jest test. However, it is unrelated to any functionality of the app.

cypress won't update live. I need to close cypress entirely every time I need to run the test again. Since I didn't have time to find a solution I couldn't finish all the tests.
